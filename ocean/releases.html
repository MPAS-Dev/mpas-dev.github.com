		<div id="apDivMain">
        <br>
            <p>MPAS-Ocean is developed within the E3SM
            repository at <a
            href="https://github.com/E3SM-Project/E3SM">https://github.com/E3SM-Project/E3SM</a>, as of May 2021.
            The code is located in the subdirectory components/mpas-ocean, and
            can be compiled as a stand-alone ocean model, or within the E3SM
            coupled climate model. We also support the Configuration Of Model
            for Prediction Across Scales Setups (COMPASS) repository at <a
            href="https://github.com/MPAS-Dev/compass">https://github.com/MPAS-Dev/compass</a>.
            COMPASS is a python package that provides an automated system
            to set up test cases for MPAS-Ocean. There is further
            documentation on both COMPASS and running MPAS-Ocean at <a
            href="https://mpas-dev.github.io/compass">https://mpas-dev.github.io/compass</a>.
