Welcome to the GPU-enabled MPAS-Atmosphere documentation!
=========================================================

This documentation describes a special branch of the MPAS-Model code with
modifications to enable the MPAS-Atmosphere model to run on heterogeneous
compute nodes through the use of OpenACC directives.

.. note:: *The use of the GPU-enabled MPAS-Atmosphere code assumes a thorough
   understanding of the standard MPAS-Atmosphere model. If you are new to
   MPAS-Atmosphere, please begin with the CPU-only,* `v7.0 release`_ *of the model.*

The remaining sections of this documentation provide details on how to
obtain, compile, and run the code on :ref:`supported platforms<Supported platforms>`.

.. _`v7.0 release`: https://github.com/MPAS-Dev/MPAS-Model/releases/tag/v7.0
