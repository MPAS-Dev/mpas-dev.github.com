Lagged radiation
================

In order to make more effective use of the full computational hardware
available on a node, and also to reduce GPU memory requirements, the RRTMG
radiation schemes are always run on the CPUs of a node, while the rest of the
physics and the dynamics are run on the GPUs of a node.

In the first model timestep of a simulation, the model state on the CPUs is
updated, the radiation schemes are run to produce tendencies due to radiation,
and those tendencies are transferred to the GPUs for use in the first dynamics
time step.

Thereafter, at the radiation calling interval specified in the
``namelist.atmosphere`` file, the current model state is transferred to the MPI
tasks running the RRTMG schemes, and radiation tendencies computed from the
lagged model state are transferred to the MPI tasks running the dynamics.  In
this way, the model dynamics running on the GPUs applies physics tendencies
that were computed from a model state valid one radiation calling interval in
the past.

A timeline of the model execution is illustrated in the figure, below.

   executing on GPUs. :math:`\phi^m` represents the model state after :math:`m`
   dynamics steps, and :math:`\dot{\phi}^m_R` represents the tendencies due to
   radiation computed from :math:`\phi^m`. The ratio of the radiation interval
   to the dynamics time step is :math:`n`.

The figure also illustrates an important point regarding model throughput: the time
spent by the CPUs to call the RRTMG schemes should ideally match the time spent by
the GPUs to run the rest of the model during each radiation coupling interval.

There are several parameters that may be used to balance the radiation computation
with the computation in the rest of the model:

1. The radiation calling interval, specified in the ``namelist.atmosphere`` file
   with the ``config_radtlw_interval`` and ``config_radtsw_interval`` options;

2. the number of MPI ranks assigned to run the RRTMG schemes on CPUs; and

3. the number of MPI ranks assigned to run the non-radiation physics and dynamics
   on GPUs.

The specification of the number of MPI ranks that will run on CPUs and on GPUs
is described in more detail in the section on :ref:`running the model<Running>`.
