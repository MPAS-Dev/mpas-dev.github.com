Compiling
=========

Compilation of the GPU-enabled MPAS-Atmosphere code is different from compiling
a standard release of MPAS-Atmosphere in only one respect: The option ``OPENACC=true``
must be added to the compilation command. For example::

    make -j 4 pgi CORE=atmosphere USE_PIO2=true OPENACC=true

Through the specification of ``OPENACC=true`` in the build command, additional
compiler flags will be added. At present, these include ``-Mnofma -acc -ta=tesla:cc70 -Minfo=accel``.

As described in the :ref:`supported platform<Supported platforms>` section, only
the PGI compilers are supported at present; accordingly, the use of ``OPENACC=true``
only adds additional flags for the ``pgi`` build target.

If the model was successfully compiled for execution on GPUs, the build summary
should indicate that OpenACC was enabled:
