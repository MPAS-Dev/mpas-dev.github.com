Supported platforms
===================

At present, the GPU-enabled MPAS-Atmosphere code is only supported on IBM's
AC922_ architecture with the PGI_ compilers.

Most testing and development has taken place on the ORNL Summit_ machine with
the following compilers and libraries:

* PGI 19.10 compilers
* zlib 1.2.11
* HDF5 1.10.5
* PnetCDF 1.12.1
* netCDF-C 4.6.3
* netCDF-Fortran 4.5.2
* PIO 2.4.4

If you have had success in porting the code to another platform, we encourage
you to let us know with a post to the MPAS-Atmosphere -> GPU/OpenACC section
of the `WRF/MPAS support forum`_.
