Requesting help
===============

Provided you are attempting to use the GPU-enabled MPAS-Atmosphere code on a
:ref:`supported platform<Supported platforms>`, a special section of the
`WRF/MPAS support forum`_ is available to discuss any issues you may encounter.
Support resources are limited, and community engagement on the forum is
encouraged.

.. note:: *In general, please* **do not** *create GitHub Issues for the purpose
   of asking for help. GitHub Issues for the MPAS-Model repository are intended
   to track code issues that in principle can be addressed through fixes to the
   code.*
