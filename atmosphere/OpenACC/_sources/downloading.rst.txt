Getting the code
================

The GPU-enabled MPAS-Atmosphere model code is available as a branch in the same
MPAS-Model repository as the standard releases. The simplest way to obtain the code is by cloning the repository from the command-line::

    git clone https://github.com/MPAS-Dev/MPAS-Model.git

After cloning the MPAS-Model repository, check out the **atmosphere/v6.x-openacc** branch::

    cd MPAS-Model
    git checkout atmosphere/v6.x-openacc
