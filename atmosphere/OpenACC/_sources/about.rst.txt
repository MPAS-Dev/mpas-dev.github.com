Important notes
===============

Besides supporting execution on GPUs, there are several other points worth
noting about the GPU-enabled MPAS-Atmosphere code:

* The GPU-enabled code branch is based on MPAS v6.x, and while there are plans
  to bring the code up-to-date with v7.0 by early 2021, anyone with a need for
  capabilities or fixes found only in MPAS v7.0 (*e.g.,* limited-area simulation)
  may prefer to use the standard release of MPAS-Atmosphere.

* MPAS-Atmosphere is the only *core* that is supported (or expected to work)
  in this code branch.

* In order to make use of all available compute resource on a node, this code
  branch contains changes to run the RRTMG radiation schemes on CPUs using
  a lagged model state, while the rest of the model runs on GPUs. See the section
  on :ref:`lagged radiation<Lagged radiation>` for more details.

* At present, only the *mesoscale_reference* physics suite is supported.
