MPAS Version 1.0 was released on 14 June 2013.&nbsp; This is the first
public release of MPAS, including the atmosphere model.&nbsp; MPAS-A
has undergone limited testing for NWP time-scale integrations (days to
weeks) and seasonal to year-long integrations for regional climate
applications, in addition to idealized testing including dry and moist
idealized baroclinic waves, squall-lines, supercells, and mountain-wave
simulations in 2D and 3D Cartesian geometries.<br>
      <br>
Considerations regarding this initial release:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>We have not tested the model for deep-atmosphere
configurations; our model top has typically been set at 30 km in real-data simulations.<br>
        </li>
        <li>The current physics suite, taken from the WRF-NRCM
configuration with a few additional options, had not been developed for
coarse meshes [dx ~ O(100 km)].&nbsp; We have observed a number of
MPAS-A failures related to physics on coarse meshes for long-term integrations with surface updates.</li>
        <li>We have only used GFS, CFSR, and NNRP data for
initialization of full-physics real-world cases. Real case
initializations using other data, like ERA-Interim data, are currently
being tested.<br>
        </li>

        <li>We have only limited post-processing capabilities at present, particularly with respect to visualization.</li>
        <li>While we have begun testing methods for interpolating the MPAS
output to latitude-longitude meshes (which would greatly expand our
post-processing capabilities), these packages are not available in this
release.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">We expect to make them available in the near future.</span><br>
        </li>
        <li>MPAS must be run under MPI because MPAS uses PIO.&nbsp; We
understand that there would be some utility to having a serial build,
and this capability may appear in a later release.<br>
        </li>
        <li>MPAS does not currently support running MPAS-Atmosphere
coupled to MPAS-Ocean.&nbsp; We anticipate that most coupled-model work
using MPAS-A will occur in CESM.&nbsp; We are, however, open to working
with others exploring coupling with other modeling systems.<br>
        </li>
        <li>MPAS-A
and MPAS-O are standalone models; this release does not contain the
CESM configurations for MPAS-A or MPAS-O, both of which are currently
under development.</li>
        <li>Data assimilation using the Data Assimilation Research
Testbed (DART) with MPAS-A is under development.&nbsp; This capability
is not available in this release.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
We welcome comments, contributions, bug reports, bug fixes, and any other feedback.<br>
