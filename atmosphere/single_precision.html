<p>
    Beginning with version 2.0, MPAS-Atmosphere can be compiled and run
    in single-precision, offering faster model execution and smaller input and
    output files. <b>Please note, however, that single-precision MPAS-Atmosphere has
    received only limited testing as of the 2.0 release.</b>
</p>

<p>
    To compile a single-precision MPAS-Atmosphere executable, it is necessary to
    first add <font class="console">-DSINGLE_PRECISION</font> to the definition of
    <font class="console">MODEL_FORMULATION</font> at the top of the main Makefile.
    We've found that some versions of the ifort compiler have difficulties with 
    certain parts of the MPAS-A solver in single precision, and consequently, it may 
    also be necessary to add <font class="console">-DSINGLE_PRECISION_IFORT</font> to 
    the specification of <font class="console">MODEL_FORMULATION</font> if using the ifort 
    compiler. Additionally, any compiler flags, such as <font
    class="console">-fdefault-real-8</font>, <font class="console">-r8</font>, or
    <font class="console">-real-size 64</font> must be removed from the compiler
    target that will be used. For example, if compiling with the gfortran compiler,
    one would change the line
</p>

<pre>        "FFLAGS_OPT = -O3 -m64 -ffree-line-length-none -fdefault-real-8 -fdefault-double-8 -fconvert=big-endian -ffree-form" \</pre>

<p>
    in the top-level Makefile to
</p>

<pre>        "FFLAGS_OPT = -O3 -m64 -ffree-line-length-none -fconvert=big-endian -ffree-form" \</pre>
<p>
    before compiling the <i>init_atmsophere_model</i> and <i>atmosphere_model</i> executables as usual.
</p>

<p> 
    Running MPAS-Atmosphere in single-precision requires the user to begin with
    single-precision SCVT grid files, and all pre-processing steps must be run using a
    single-precision version of <i>init_atmosphere_model</i> with these grid files.
    In order to obtain suitable grid files, any existing double-precision SCVT grid
    file that was downloaded from the 
    <a href="atmosphere_meshes.html">MPAS-Atmosphere meshes download page</a> may be
    run through the <a href="http://www.mmm.ucar.edu/projects/mpas/atmosphere_meshes/double_to_float_grid.f90" target="_blank">double_to_float_grid</a>
    converter program to produce a single-precision grid file.  <b>Using the
    double-precision grid files with single-precision executables will not work.</b>
